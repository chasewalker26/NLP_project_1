# CAP 6640 Project 1: NLP Model For Funny Sentence Classification

Example training and evaluation of BERT:

Train:

`py -3 BERT_trainer.py `

Evaluate:

`py -3 BERT_trainer.py --evaluate --data_file datasets/combo_dataset.csv`

Follow this same procedure to train and evaluate LSTM.

You can use training_grapher.ipynb to visualize the loss and accuracy of the model training.
